# Ogami ERP — Core Modules Testing Guide (Superadmin)

> **Account:** `superadmin@ogamierp.local` / `SuperAdmin@12345!`
> **Environment:** `http://localhost:5173`
> ⚠️ **Before starting — LOCAL / STAGING ONLY:** `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` then `npm run dev`
> **⛔ WARNING: `migrate:fresh` PERMANENTLY DELETES ALL DATABASE DATA.** Only run this on a local or staging environment. Never run it on a production server. If the server has already been used, the re-seed will restore default accounts only — all manually created transactional data (POs, GRs, invoices, etc.) will be gone.
> **Single account throughout** — no login/logout required between steps.

This guide covers all core operational and financial modules in one connected real-life manufacturing cycle:

**Procurement → Inventory → AP (Pay Vendor) → Production → Maintenance → Mold → QC → Delivery → AR (Bill Customer) → Accounting → ISO**

Run the scenarios **in order** — each one produces data used by the next.

### Real-Life Timeline

## What Is Seeded vs. What You Create Manually

### Seeded automatically by `migrate:fresh --seed`

| Category | What | Why seeded |
|----------|------|------------|
| **Chart of Accounts** | 16 accounts (1001 Cash, 2001 AP, 3001 AR, 4001 Revenue, 5001 Wages, 6001 Expense, etc.) | Account codes are **hardcoded** in every AP/AR/GL auto-posting service — creating them manually with different codes would break all automated journal entries |
| **Fiscal Periods** | Nov 2025, Dec 2025, Jan 2026 *(closed)*, Feb 2026, Mar 2026 *(open)* | Calendar reference data; March 2026 is the period used throughout these scenarios |
| **Rate Tables** | SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, tax brackets, OT multipliers, holiday calendar | Government-mandated tables — not business data |
| **RBAC + User Accounts** | Roles, permissions, 21 user accounts (admin, hr.manager, manufacturing roles, etc.) | Access control setup |
| **Org Structure** | Departments (HR, PROD, QC, MOLD, WH, etc.), positions, salary grades | Reference data for employee linking |
| **Fleet Vehicles** | TRUCK-001, TRUCK-002, VAN-001 — Mitsubishi L300 Van | Required for shipment creation |

### Created manually in Scenario 0 (below)

Everything else: bank account, vendor, customer, item category, item masters, warehouse location, bill of materials.

## Scenario 1 — Procurement: Full PR → PO → GR Cycle

> **Story:** The warehouse is low on PP Resin. A purchase request is raised for 500 kg, pushed through the full approval chain, converted to a PO, and goods are received in two deliveries (498 kg + 2 kg).

> **Queue prerequisite:** Inventory stock updates and AP invoice auto-creation are processed by a queue worker. Make sure `npm run dev` (or `php artisan queue:work`) is running before confirming GRs.

### 1.1 Create a Purchase Request

1. Go to **Procurement → Purchase Requests → New**
2. Fill in:
   - **Department:** Production
   - **Urgency:** Normal
   - **Justification:** Warehouse stock of PP Resin Natural is below safety level. Requesting 500 kg to cover the March production run.
3. Add a line item — click **+ Add Item**:
   - **Description:** `PP Resin Natural` *(free text — PRs have no item dropdown)*
   - **UoM:** kg
   - **Qty:** 500 · **Unit Cost:** ₱180.00 → **Est. Total:** ₱90,000.00
4. Click **Save**, then on the detail page click **Submit**
5. ✅ Status: `submitted` · Reference: `PR-2026-03-00001`

### 1.2 Push Through the Approval Chain

| Step | Button | Remark | Final Status |

| 1 — Head | **Note** | *Stock below reorder level* | `noted` |
| 2 — Manager | **Check** | *Approved for purchase* | `checked` |
| 3 — Officer | **Review** | *Chinatown Resins confirmed, lead time 3 days* | `reviewed` |
| 4 — VP | **VP Approve** | *(none required)* | `approved` |

✅ The **Create PO** button appears on the PR detail page.

### 1.3 Convert to Purchase Order

1. On the approved PR detail page, click **Create PO**
2. The form opens pre-filled — PO is locked to this PR; line items (description, UOM, qty) are copied from the PR and are read-only
3. Fill in the header fields:
   - **Vendor:** Chinatown Resins Inc.
   - **Delivery Date:** 2026-03-18
   - **Payment Terms:** Net 30
4. For each line item, select the matching **Item Master** entry:
   - In the **Item Master** dropdown (first column of the line item row), search and select **PP Resin Natural**
   - The **Unit of Measure** field auto-fills to `kg` from the Item Master; the **Description** remains read-only (`PP Resin Natural` from the PR)
   - Set **Unit Price:** ₱180.00 (confirm or enter if not pre-filled)

   > ⚠️ **Item Master is now required on every PO line item.** Purchase Requests use free-text descriptions; the PO is the point where each line must be linked to a verified Item Master record. If the item does not yet exist in **Inventory → Item Master**, create it there first before proceeding.

5. Click **Create PO**, then on the PO detail page click **Send to Vendor**
6. ✅ Status: `sent` · Reference: `PO-2026-03-00001`
7. ✅ PR status is now `converted_to_po`
8. ✅ Each PO line item is now linked to an Item Master record — stock updates on GR confirmation will use this link directly (no fuzzy name matching)

### 1.4 Record First Goods Receipt (498 kg — short delivery)

1. On the PO detail page, click **Receive Goods**
2. In the GR form:
   - **Received Date:** 2026-03-18
   - **Qty Received:** change `500` → `498`
   - All other fields: leave as default
3. Click **Record Goods Receipt**, then on the GR detail page click **Confirm Receipt & Run 3-Way Match**
4. ✅ Status: `confirmed` · Reference: `GR-2026-03-00001`
5. ✅ PO status: `partially_received`
4. ✅ **Inventory → Stock Balances:** PP Resin Natural increases by 498 kg *(requires queue worker)*
7. ✅ **Accounting → AP Invoices:** a draft AP invoice for Chinatown Resins is auto-created *(requires queue worker)*

### 1.5 Record Second Goods Receipt (remaining 2 kg)

1. On the PO detail page (status `partially_received`), click **Receive Goods**
2. In the GR form:
   - **Received Date:** 2026-03-21
   - **Qty Received:** `2` *(pre-filled from outstanding balance)*
3. Click **Record Goods Receipt** → **Confirm Receipt & Run 3-Way Match**
4. ✅ PO status: `fully_received`
5. ✅ **Inventory → Stock Balances:** PP Resin Natural total = 500 kg
6. ✅ A second draft AP invoice for the remaining 2 kg (₱360) is auto-created

> **Two draft AP invoices now exist in Accounting → AP Invoices:**
> - GR-2026-03-00001 → ₱89,640 (498 kg × ₱180)
> - GR-2026-03-00002 → ₱360 (2 kg × ₱180)
>
> Continue to **Scenario 2** (Inventory), then **Scenario 3** (AP) to approve and pay both invoices.

---

## Scenario 2 — Inventory: IQC Inspection, Stock Verification, and Material Issuance

> **Story:** On the same day the goods arrive (March 18), QC performs an incoming inspection on RAW-001. The warehouse then verifies on-hand balances and issues 200 kg to Production via material requisition.
>
> **Why do this manually here?** This scenario exists to exercise the full MRQ module (create → approve → fulfill) as a standalone inventory exercise. In a real production workflow you would **skip the manual MRQ** and instead rely on the auto-MRQ generated when the Work Order is released in Scenario 4.3 — the warehouse would approve and fulfill that auto-MRQ to formally issue stock. Both paths do the same thing; the guide does both so every module gets covered.

### 2.1 Incoming Material Inspection (IQC)

> IQC is performed at the warehouse on the day goods are received — before materials are issued to Production.

1. Go to **QC / QA → Inspections → New**
2. Fill in:
   - **Stage:** select **IQC — Incoming Quality Control**
   - **Inspection Date:** 2026-03-18
   - **Item:** select **PP Resin Natural** *(displayed as `ITEM-XXXXXX — PP Resin Natural`)*
   - **Qty Inspected:** 50
   - **Template:** leave as **— None —** *(no templates seeded)*
   - **Inspector:** *(optional — dropdown shows QC dept employees only; leave blank if none exist)*
   - **Remarks:** *(optional)*
3. Click **Create Inspection**
4. On the detail page, click **Submit Results**
5. Add criteria rows using **+ Add Row** (one row per check):

   | Criterion | Measured / Observed | Meets Spec? |
   |-----------|---------------------|-------------|
   | Visual contamination | clean | Pass |
   | Moisture content | 0.03% | Pass |
   | Melt Flow Index | 13.2 | Pass |

6. Enter **Units Passed:** `50`, then click **Submit Results**
7. ✅ Inspection status: `passed`; reference `INS-2026-IQC-001`

### 2.2 Verify Stock Balance

1. Go to **Inventory → Stock Balances**
2. Search for **PP Resin Natural**
3. ✅ On-hand qty ≈ 500 kg (from Scenario 1)

### 2.3 Check Stock Ledger

1. Go to **Inventory → Stock Ledger**
2. Filter by **Item:** PP Resin Natural
3. ✅ Two inbound transactions visible — GR-2026-03-00001 (498 kg) and GR-2026-03-00002 (2 kg)
4. ✅ Running balance column reflects cumulative totals correctly

### 2.4 Create a Material Requisition

1. Go to **Inventory → Requisitions → New**
2. Fill in:
   - **Department:** Production
   - **Purpose:** Materials for March production run for FGD-001 *(min 10 characters)*
3. In the **Line Items** section, search and select items from the **item dropdown** (existing inventory items):
   - **Item:** search for `PP Resin Natural` → select **PP Resin Natural** from the dropdown
   - **Qty:** 200
   - **Remarks:** *(optional)*
4. Click **Submit**
5. ✅ MRQ reference generated; status `submitted`

> **Note:** Unlike PRs, MRQ line items use a **searchable item dropdown** linked to the Item Master — not free text.

### 2.5 Push MRQ Through Approval Chain

| Step | Button | Final Status |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 — Head | **Note** | `noted` |
| 2 — Manager | **Check** | `checked` |
| 3 — Officer | **Review** | `reviewed` |
| 4 — VP | **VP Approve** | `approved` |

### 2.6 Fulfill the Requisition

1. On the approved MRQ, click **Fulfill Requisition**
2. ✅ Status: `fulfilled`
3. ✅ **Inventory → Stock Balances:** PP Resin Natural decreases by 200 kg → ≈ 300 kg remaining
4. ✅ **Inventory → Stock Ledger:** new outbound transaction logged (source: MRQ)

## Scenario 3 — Accounts Payable: Vendor Invoice Approval and Payment

> **Story:** Two AP invoices for Chinatown Resins Inc. were auto-created when the GRs were confirmed in Scenario 1. Before production begins, finance processes these invoices — push through the 5-step approval chain, then record payment.

### 3.1 Locate the Auto-Created AP Invoices

1. Go to **Accounting → AP Invoices**
2. You should see two draft invoices for **Chinatown Resins Inc.**:
   - ₱89,640 — auto-created from GR-2026-03-00001 (498 kg × ₱180)
   - ₱360 — auto-created from GR-2026-03-00002 (2 kg × ₱180)
3. ✅ Both are in `draft` status with description `Auto-created from GR...`

> **If the invoices are missing:** Check that the queue worker ran after confirming the GRs. If needed, create manually: **AP Invoices → New**, Vendor: Chinatown Resins Inc., Fiscal Period: March 2026, AP Account: 2001, Expense Account: 6001, Invoice Date: 2026-03-18, Due Date: 2026-04-17, Net Amount: ₱89,640 (first) and ₱360 (second).

### 3.2 Push Through the 5-Step AP Approval Chain

> Open each invoice by clicking **View →** on the list, then use the action buttons on the detail page.

| Step | Button on detail page | Expected Status |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Submit for Approval** | `pending_approval` |
| 2 | **Head Note** | `head_noted` |
| 3 | **Manager Check** | `manager_checked` |
| 4 | **Officer Review** | `officer_reviewed` |
| 5 | **Approve** | `approved` |

> Repeat for both invoices. EWT is auto-computed per-invoice at 2% of net amount upon approval.

✅ After approving the ₱89,640 invoice: EWT ₱1,792.80 computed automatically  
✅ GL entry auto-posted:
- DR Materials/Expense ₱89,640
- CR Accounts Payable ₱89,640

### 3.3 Record Vendor Payment

1. Open an approved AP invoice → click **View →** from the AP Invoices list
2. Click **Record Payment**:
   - For the ₱89,640 invoice: **Amount:** ₱87,847.20 *(₱89,640 − 2% EWT ₱1,792.80)*
   - For the ₱360 invoice: **Amount:** ₱352.80 *(₱360 − 2% EWT ₱7.20)*
   - **Payment Date:** 2026-03-25
   - **Bank Account:** select the operating bank account
3. Click **Save**
4. ✅ Invoice status: `paid`
5. ✅ GL entry per invoice:
   - DR Accounts Payable (invoice net)
   - CR EWT Payable (2% EWT)
   - CR Cash / Bank (net − EWT)
6. Repeat for the second invoice
7. Go to **Financial Reports → General Ledger** → select **Account:** `2001 — Accounts Payable`, set date range for March 2026, click **Run Report** → ✅ closing balance = ₱0

---

## Scenario 4 — Production: Work Order Execution

> **Story:** Production runs 10,000 units of Plastic Container 500ml for an Ace Hardware order scheduled for March 28, using the 200 kg of RAW-001 issued in Scenario 2.

### 4.1 Create a Delivery Schedule

1. Go to **Production → Delivery Schedules → New**
2. Fill in:
   - **Customer:** Ace Hardware Philippines *(dropdown)*
   - **Product Item:** Plastic Container 500ml *(dropdown — finished goods only)*
   - **Qty Ordered:** 10,000
   - **Target Delivery Date:** 2026-03-28
   - **Type:** Local
   - **Notes:** *(optional)*
3. Click **Save**
4. ✅ Status `open`; schedule visible on the board

### 4.2 Review the Bill of Materials

1. Go to **Production → Bill of Materials**
2. Open the BOM for **Plastic Container 500ml**
3. ✅ Component list shows PP Resin Natural and HDPE Resin Black with per-unit quantities and routing steps

### 4.3 Create, Release, and Start the Production Order

1. Go to **Production → Orders → New**
2. Fill in:
   - **Product Item:** Plastic Container 500ml *(dropdown — select item first)*
   - **BOM:** *(auto-filters to BOMs for the selected item — select the active BOM)*
   - **Delivery Schedule:** *(optional dropdown — link to the schedule created in 4.1)*
   - **Qty Required:** 10,000
   - **Target Start Date:** 2026-03-22, **Target End Date:** 2026-03-25
   - **Notes:** *(optional)*
3. Click **Create** (status `draft`) → **Release** (status `released`) → **Start** (status `in_progress`)
4. ✅ Production order reference generated (e.g., `WO-2026-03-00001`)

> **Auto-MRQ on Release:** When you click **Release**, the system automatically creates a **draft Material Requisition** (e.g., `MRQ-2026-03-00002`) in **Inventory → Requisitions** — pre-filled with the component quantities from the BOM scaled to `Qty Required`. This is the **intended real-world mechanism** for issuing stock to production: release the WO → warehouse approves and fulfills the auto-MRQ → materials formally deducted from stock.
>
> **Why does it appear here if we already did Scenario 2.6?** In this guide the manual MRQ in Scenario 2 was used to demo the MRQ module as a standalone exercise *before* the WO existed. In practice you would only do one or the other — not both. Because Scenario 2.6 already fulfilled 200 kg, the auto-MRQ here is **redundant** and you can safely ignore it (leave it as draft). No double-deduction occurs unless it is explicitly approved and fulfilled.
>
> **⚠️ The auto-MRQ does not block the WO.** The WO transitions `released → in_progress → completed` regardless of whether the MRQ is ever touched.

### 4.4 Log Output and Complete

1. On the `in_progress` order, click **Log Output**:
   - **Shift:** Shift A *(dropdown: A / B / C — tracks which shift produced the output)*
   - **Date:** 2026-03-28
   - **Operator:** *(select any employee from the dropdown — records who ran the production run)*
   - **Qty Produced:** 10,050
   - **Qty Rejected (scrap):** 43
   - **Remarks:** *(optional)*
2. Click **Submit Log**, then click **Mark Complete**
3. ✅ Status: `completed`
4. ✅ **Inventory → Stock Balances:** Plastic Container 500ml increases by **10,007 units** (10,050 − 43)
5. ✅ PP Resin Natural stock decreases proportionally (consumed per BOM)
6. ✅ A **Draft Outbound Delivery Receipt** is auto-created (linked to the delivery schedule)

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| PR form has no Title field | Correct — fill **Justification** (min 20 chars) and **Urgency** instead |
| PR line items have no item dropdown | Correct — PR uses **free-text Description**. MRQ uses the item master dropdown |
| GR form asks for PO Item ID | Use the **Receive Goods** button on the PO detail page — items are auto-populated with the correct PO item IDs. Manual entry is only needed when creating a GR from the Goods Receipts list directly |
| GR does not link to PO | Ensure PO is in `sent` or `partially_received` status before creating the GR |
| Receive Goods button not visible on PO | PO must be in `sent` or `partially_received` status — the button is hidden for `draft`, `fully_received`, `closed`, and `cancelled` POs |
| 3-way match draft invoice missing | Check that GR status is `confirmed` and queue worker is running |
| AP invoice 409 on Head Note | Ensure invoice is in `pending_approval` status — click **Submit** before **Head Note** |
| AP invoice 409 on Approve | Must complete all 5 steps in order: Submit → Head Note → Manager Check → Officer Review → Approve |
| NCR creation rejected | NCR requires a **Linked Inspection** — create the failing IPQC inspection first (step 7.1) |
| Mold log field is "Shot Count" | Correct label — not "Shots This Run". Date field is "Log Date" not "Production Date" |
| AR invoice has no line items | Correct — AR invoices record a **Subtotal** amount. Enter the net total; VAT is auto-computed |
| AP invoice has no Invoice No field | The field is **OR Number** (vendor's OR/invoice reference) — optional |
| AP invoice EWT not filling in | EWT is auto-computed from vendor setup, not a form input |
| ISO Document No not editable | Document number is system-generated — no manual input field |
| ISO Audit has no Clauses field | Include clause references in the **Audit Scope** text field |
| Plastic Container 500ml stock not updated after production | Work order must reach `completed` status |
| Auto outbound DR not created | Verify production order has a `delivery_schedule_id` linked |
| AP invoice GL accounts blank | Seeder must have CoA codes `2001` and `6001` — re-run `ChartOfAccountsSeeder` if missing |
| Output VAT not posted on AR | AR invoice must reach `approved` status |
| Trial balance debits ≠ credits | Check **Accounting → Journal Entries** for any entries stuck in `draft` or `submitted` |
| Mold preventive WO not auto-created | Confirm `current_shots >= max_shots` after logging; check queue worker is running (`php artisan queue:work`) |
| CAPA not auto-created on audit finding | Check queue worker; `AuditFindingCreated` event is queued |
| ISO document not visible | Effective date must be set; status must be `approved` |
